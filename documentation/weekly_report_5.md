# Weekly report 5

## What has happened during this week?

- Key creation using 1024bit numbers
- Square-and-multiply algorithm for more efficient calculations
- Better tests
- Code style improvements
- Bug fixes

Time spent: >20h

## What I learned?

A lot about testing. Patching a fuction call inde a function with predetermined values wasn't as easy as I thought.

## Problems

Might need some help with FFT-based multiplication and various forms of testing.

## Next week

- Faster key creation
- Encryption/decryption part of the project
- Hopefully some documentation
