# Weekly report 4

## What has happened during this week?

- First version GUI
- Progress on key creation part

~ 18 hours

## Problems

Logic behind key generation now works and produces correct results. However, only with small (<20 bits in length) prime numbers. Hopefully get more own algorithms up and running by next week to handle correct size numbers efficiently.

## Next week

- Own algorithms for key generation
- Documentation
