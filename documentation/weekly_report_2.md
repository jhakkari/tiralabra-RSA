# Weekly report 2

## What has happened during this week?

- Writing algorithms
- Github actions and Codecov setup
- Testing


| date | time |  target |
| :----:|:-----| :-----|
| 2.11. | 5    | Miller-Rabin primality test |
| 11.11. | 4    | GHA and codecov setup |

## Problems

Starting this project straight from the algorithms wasn't a very good idea. Slowed whole progress down. Put a placeholder up for now.
How manu rounds of testing is suitable for prime numbers? Default is set to 40 now.

## Next week

- Hopefully get GUI and key creation part of the project and up and running. More testing.
