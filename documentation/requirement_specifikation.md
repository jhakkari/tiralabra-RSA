# Requirement specification

This project aims to generate secure cryptographic keys in compliance with the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptosystem. This app can also encrypt/decrypt text using generated keys. 

## Algorithms

### Miller-Rabin Primality Test

Required large prime numbers are chosen using the Miller-Rabin primality test.

### Extended Euclidean Algorithm

Calculates the greatest common divisor for given integers and coefficients x,y such that ax + by = gcd(a,b).
Required during key creation.

### RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Algorithm

In the end, cryptographic keys are generated based on the output of the above algorithms using the RSA algorithm. The key length is 2048 bits.

## Inputs and outputs

- Key generation: No input needed.
- Encryption: Recipient's public key and message to be ciphered needed. Ciphered message printed to GUI.
- Decryption: Recipient's private key and ciphered message required. Original message printed to GUI.

## Other information

- Programming language: Python
- Code/documentation language: English
- Degree program: Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science

(I have taken basic programming courses using Java, so peer review with that is also a possibility)
